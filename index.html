        If your photos aren't good enough, then you're not close enough <br />
        When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs<br />
        In photography there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real
        than reality<br />
        There is one thing the photograph must contain, the humanity of the
        moment
      </p>
      <p>
        I really believe there are things nobody would see if I didn't
        photograph them — Diane Arbus<br />
        It's about reacting to what you see, hopefully without preconception.<br />
        You can find pictures anywhere. <br />It's simply a matter of noticing
        things and organizing them. <br />You just have to care about what’s
        around you and have a concern with humanity and the human comedy.” —
        Elliott Erwitt<br />
        Photographs open doors into the past, but they also allow a look into
        the future.” — Sally Mann
